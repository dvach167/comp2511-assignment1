                            Culture Shock When Traveling Abroad

                            Adapting to a new and diverse environment is one of the social challenges that undergraduate students are faced with. 
                            For many students, going to college means leaving their familiar surroundings and entering a different world, 
                            where they meet people from various backgrounds and perspectives. This can be a stimulating and enriching experience, 
                            but also a daunting and stressful one, as students have to learn how to communicate and collaborate with others who may 
                            have different values, beliefs, and expectations. Some students may feel out of place, lonely, or misunderstood, while 
                            others may have difficulty managing their time and priorities between their academic and social lives. 
                            To overcome this challenge, students need to develop intercultural competence, which is the ability to appreciate, 
                            respect, and adapt to cultural differences. They also need to seek support from their peers and mentors, who can offer 
                            guidance, friendship, and feedback. Moreover, they need to explore the opportunities and resources available on campus, 
                            such as clubs, events, and programs, that can help them broaden their horizons and enhance their skills.

                            Juggling Financial Stress and The Vicious Cycle of School

                            Coping with financial stress is another social challenge that undergraduate students are faced with. 
                            Many students come from low-income families or face economic hardships, especially at less-selective colleges. 
                            These students often have trouble paying for their education and living expenses, as well as accessing financial aid 
                            and assistance. They may have to work long hours, take on debt, or drop out of school. Financial stress can have 
                            negative impacts on students' mental health, academic performance, and career prospects. To overcome this challenge, 
                            students need to plan their budget, which is the process of estimating and allocating their income and expenses. 
                            They also need to apply for financial aid, which is the money that is given or lent to students to help them pay for 
                            their education. They can look for scholarships, grants, and loans that suit their needs and eligibility. 
                            Furthermore, they need to seek part-time or online jobs, which can provide them with extra income and work experience. 
                            Additionally, they need to utilize financial literacy programs and services, which can teach them how to manage their 
                            money and make informed decisions.
